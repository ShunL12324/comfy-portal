## Introduction

Welcome to Comfy Portal. We take your privacy seriously and want to be transparent about our practices. Comfy Portal is a utility app designed to help you manage and run your ComfyUI workflows. We believe in data minimalism and user privacy.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any personal information or usage data.** Comfy Portal operates as a standalone tool with all data stored locally on your device:

- **Server Connections:** Your ComfyUI server addresses are stored locally on your device only
- **Generated Images:** All images are processed and stored locally
- **App Settings:** Your preferences and settings are stored locally on your device

## Local Storage

All data is stored locally on your device:

- Server connection information is saved in your device's local storage
- Generated images are saved to your device's storage
- App settings and preferences remain on your device

We have no access to any of this information as it never leaves your device.

## System Crash Reports

While we do not collect crash data directly, please be aware that:
- Your device's operating system (iOS/Android) may collect crash reports
- These system-level crash reports are handled by Apple/Google according to their respective privacy policies
- You can control crash reporting settings through your device's system settings

## Third-Party Services

The app connects only to:
- Your self-hosted ComfyUI servers (as configured by you)
- Our GitHub Pages for displaying this privacy policy and terms of service

We do not use any analytics services, tracking tools, or other third-party services that collect data.

## Third-Party Server Usage

**Important Notice About Third-Party Servers:**

- If you choose to connect to a ComfyUI server operated by a third party:
  - We are not responsible for the privacy practices of that server
  - Your data (including images and prompts) may be processed, stored, or logged by the third-party server
  - The third-party server operator may have their own privacy policies and data collection practices
  - Your prompts might contain personal preferences or sensitive information
  - We strongly recommend:
    - Only connecting to servers you trust
    - Reading the privacy policy of any third-party server you use
    - Using your own self-hosted server for sensitive content
    - Being mindful of the personal information you include in your prompts
  - We cannot guarantee the privacy or security of data transmitted to third-party servers

## Your Data Rights

Since we don't collect any data, there is no need for:
- Data access requests
- Data deletion requests
- Data portability

All your data is under your direct control on your device.

## App Permissions

The app requests the following permissions for basic functionality:

- **Photo Library Access:**
  - To save generated images to your photo library
  - To set preview images for your workflows
  - We never upload your photos to any server
  - All image processing is done locally on your device
- **Network Access:**
  - Only used for connecting to your ComfyUI servers
  - Required for fetching this privacy policy and terms of service from GitHub Pages
- **Storage Access:**
  - For saving app settings and workflow configurations locally
  - For temporary storage of generated images before saving to photo library

## Age Restrictions

Comfy Portal is rated 17+ and is intended for mature users only. This rating reflects:
- The technical nature of the app requiring server infrastructure knowledge
- The potential mature content that can be generated through AI models
- The responsibility required in using AI generation tools

The app is not intended for users under 17 years of age. Users must comply with their local age restrictions and regulations regarding AI content generation tools.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new policy on this page.
