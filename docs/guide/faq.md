## Connection Settings

### Do I need to include http/s prefix when entering the host?

No. This is because Comfy Portal communicates with the server using both HTTP protocol and WebSocket. The system will handle the protocol prefixes automatically - you only need to enter the domain name or IP address.

### I cannot connect to my server, how should I troubleshoot?

1. First, please confirm that you can access the server via a browser on your device.
2. If you can access it via browser but not through the app, try adjusting the "Use SSL" option and refresh.

## Performance

### Why does it take so long to download images after they are generated?

Download speed primarily depends on your network connection quality. If you're using a local WiFi network, you can try these optimization tips:

- Ensure the device running ComfyUI server is positioned closer to the WiFi router
- Keep your device closer to the WiFi router
- Avoid having too many physical obstacles between the router and devices
